# Eyes
## Exercise on eyes
The image you see below is how the project began. The problem we were given was to create another eye that functioned the same way. 

### How to run
I like to run the HTML with the Live Server extension in VS Code, just make sure you have all three source files open from the project folder after you clone the repo. 

### Road Map
Future version of this will add transformations to the divs based on click events, such as a change in facial expressions or squinting the eyes.
