# Eyes
The challenge for this exercise was to add another eye. I also used CSS to style it up abit. 

## How to run.

After cloning the repo I recommend running the HTML in the browser by opening with VS Code Live Server extension in the index.html file. 
Feel free to explore the code and see what other changes you can make!
